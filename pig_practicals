1) find total number of customers for each profession

2) top ten customers from sales data along with their full details

for local mode

Pig -x local

for mapreduce mode

grunt&gt;

Pig Programming

A. Load Customer records

from local file system

cust = LOAD &#39;/home/hduser/custs&#39; using

PigStorage(&#39;,&#39;) AS ( custid, firstname, lastname,

age:long, profession);

describe cust;

dump cust;

teacher_bag = filter cust by profession==&#39;Teacher&#39;;

from hdfs

cust = LOAD &#39;/user/hduser/custs&#39; USING

PigStorage(&#39;,&#39;) AS ( custid, firstname, lastname,

age:long, profession);

dump cust;

B. Select only 10 records

amt = LIMIT cust 10;

dump amt;

describe amt;

C. Group customer records by profession

groupbyprofession = GROUP cust BY profession;

describe groupbyprofession;

dump groupbyprofession;

D. Count no of customers by profession

countbyprofession = FOREACH groupbyprofession

GENERATE group as profession, COUNT (cust) as

headcount;

describe countbyprofession;

dump countbyprofession;

D 2. Sorting the output by profession

orderbyprofession = order countbyprofession by $0;

dump orderbyprofession;

store orderbyprofession into

&#39;/home/hduser/cust_count&#39;;

illustrate orderbyprofession;

E. Load transaction records

txn = LOAD &#39;/home/hduser/txns1.txt&#39; USING

PigStorage(&#39;,&#39;) AS ( txnid, date, custid,

amount:double, category, product, city, state, type);

F. Group transactions by customer

txnbycust = group txn by custid;

dump txnbycust;

G. Sum total amount spent by each customer

spendbycust = foreach txnbycust generate group as

customer_id, ROUND_TO(SUM(txn.amount ),2) as

totalsales;

dump spendbycust;

H. Order the customer records beginning from highest

spender

custorder = order spendbycust by $1 desc;

dump custorder;

I. Select only top 10 customers

top10cust = limit custorder 10;

dump top10cust;

J. Join the transactions with customer details

top10join = join top10cust by $0, cust by $0;

describe top10join;

dump top10join;

K. Select the required fields from the join for final output

top10 = foreach top10join generate $0, $3, $4, $5, $6,

$1;

dump top10;

top10order = order top10 by $5 desc;

describe top10order;

L. Dump and store the final output

dump top10order;

store top10order into &#39;/home/hduser/pig_result&#39;;

Also find

1) total sales

2) total cash sales with %

3) total credit card sales with %

Hint : to calculate total sales

bagname = Group &lt;oldbag&gt; ALL

Also find

Track customers whose age is less than 50 and total purchases done more than USD 500
